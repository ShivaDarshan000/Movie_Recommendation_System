# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning

This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** using content-based filtering. It suggests movies similar to the one selected by the user based on features like genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

## 📌 Project Overview

Recommendation systems are widely used in platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify to suggest relevant content to users. This project demonstrates a **Content-Based Movie Recommender System** built using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Recommend similar movies based on input title
- 🧠 Uses movie metadata (genres, cast, crew, keywords)
- ✅ Content-based filtering using cosine similarity
- 📦 Trained on the TMDB movie dataset
- 🎯 Clean and interactive recommendation logic

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Content-Based Filtering
- Text Vectorization with CountVectorizer
- Cosine Similarity for similarity scoring
- Feature engineering from multiple columns

- ## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (optional for preprocessing)

## ▶️ How to Run

Install required packages:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

Run the notebook: Open Untitled0.ipynb in Jupyter and run all cells.
Search for a movie: Simply enter a movie title in the function call to get recommendations:
